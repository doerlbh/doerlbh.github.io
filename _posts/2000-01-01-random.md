here is a test
Xinxin is lovely
DNA computing? Seelig Nature
Multiplex CRISPR computing? GMC Nature
fitness evolution, ucsf, kortemme lab
David report first
Felix polymer into protein
and also chromatin
what a day
rDNA still worth pursuing but have to say more molecular and structural exploration would be much more interesting~
should not use random chosen states, but use the probablities calculated based on all thress sates
chromatin looping?
information into a review type thing
or it could be nothing
how to connect my dynamics rigid-body to DNA or protein looping

another day of entering github journal...
MathBio PhD or SynBio or SysBio or CompBio???
Or Google Genomics?
FZ talk? Not gonna stop
Need to solidify some programs to apply
weekend plan
decide programs, send refer help
contact FY, sned email to several prf

Markov Chain in other axis??? like in environment
Can we infer the entire enviorment based on a point
In a chessboard, how many grids do we need to mark down entire chess board.
stochastic gene expression
on JP paper, we can do stochastic modeling
thx jai & reply qi
for stochastic process of iR is there any better quantificaiton
iPSCs basals to think about in a simutaneous form

school ranks
end
resort ML AI projects and potential collaborations
book flights, compare schools
what do I wish to focus
make plan for courses next
adv physics, app math, sys bio
plan time
what makes a good biologidt
today I am learning Python. A new language that I used to think it is easy and not worthwhile.
It turned out to be a huge mistake.
Now I find it a very interesting programming tool that can enable me to do many things in data science and a geeky lifestyle.
I am very looking forward to it.!
